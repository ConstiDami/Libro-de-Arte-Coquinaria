Annotation campaign and model training project on Transkribus for the Semantic Digital Libraries course given by prof. Giovanni Colavizza at the University of Bologna. 2021-2022.

This repository contains a python function calculating the interannotator agreement for the pilot phase of the transcription. 
It takes into input two TXT files. For our project, each annotator transcribed the same three pages from the manuscript (pages 3, 34 and 40 as indicated in the names of the files). To use the function, write the names of two files containing different transcriptions of the same page at the last line of the script and run it.

On the repository are also available the final report and presentation of the project, presented in January 2022.
